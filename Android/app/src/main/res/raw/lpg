If inhaled, LPG can displace air, deprive your  lungs of oxygen and cause hypoxia leading to suffocation. The gas can also affect your brain and nervous system and cause euphoria (happy feeling), difficulty walking or speaking, dizziness, hallucinations, lack of coordination, nausea and loss of consciousness. Repeated exposure may cause mood swings, depression, seizures, brain haemorrhage and impaired memory. It may also damage your heart by causing irregular heart beat and high blood pressure. It may also reduce blood cells, damage lungs and cause liver and kidney inflammation.
